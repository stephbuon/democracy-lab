['It was absurd to say that landlords should have the power of evicting without being prepared for resistance on the part of the evicted persons, which would sometimes take the form of agrarian crime and outrage. I have shown also that it is totally inaccurate to say that the landlord has no power of going into Court, because, in the matter of tenant right, which he can check in no other way, this Bill authorizes him to go into the Court. Surely the landlord ought also to have equal power to take his tenant into Court, and show that his rent was just and moderate. Her Majestys Government thought that the landlord should have power to object to the new tenant, but only on reasonable grounds; and that power, accordingly, they proposed to leave to him. Neither landlords nor speculators should have power in the matter. Friends objected to the Amendment; but would they bear this in mind—that what was to be feared, and what the Conservative Members desired, was that the landlords might have the power, if they desired to use it, of suggesting and compelling emigration? Member, he might say that the principal point was the proposition that the landlord should have the power, if he thought fit, of conferring a present tenancy on his future tenant. and gallant Member proposes that the landlord shall have the power of compelling the State to purchase. Why, he asked, should the landlord have the power to increase the rent unless there had been some such ground for it? If the rent was too low the landlord might raise it; the landlord always had absolute power in the background, whatever custom might prevail. Up to this present time the landlord, and the landlord alone, has had the power to evict a tenant or make the sale of a holding, because he could refuse to take any tenant who purchased under a sheriffs sale. My Lords, that which this Bill gives to the tenant is perpetuity of tenure, subject to revision of rent at intervals of 15 years; we are told that the landlord is to have the power of resumption, and that resumption is inconsistent with perpetuity. In that country, the tenant having expended his capital or labour, the landlord had the power to move him out of his holding, that tenant, perhaps, having expended on that holding, in increasing its value, the whole of his life-long savings. Down to 1870 the landlord had the power of raising the rent, with the alternative of evicting the tenant and appropriating the full amount of these two elements, to only one of which, in equity, he had any right whatever. The noble Lord said, the object of the Amendment was that where two persons were willing to purchase a particular lot, the landlord should have the power of making the selection most advantageous to the estate. He thought such a sale would be injurious to the tenant and not beneficial to the landlord; and as the landlord had ample power at present he saw no occasion for the Amendment. Fortunately, in Scotland, the landlords had powers which the Irish landlords had not—namely, that of unroofing the cottage and getting rid of the persons so brought in—and thus they were able to remedy the evil. With regard to the present proposal on the Lords Amendment, one would have thought a year ago that it was natural that the landlord should have the power of resuming a portion of his land for the general benefit of his estate; but they were now so entirely divorced from the old position of the landlords that he hardly knew how the Government were to deal with a question of this sort. Did they propose that, if any tenant was able to show that improvements had been made on his holding of a permanent character, or that waste lands had been reclaimed any number of years ago, he should be entitled to a diminution of rent, and that the landlord should have no power of showing that the rent had been moderate and that the tenant had received the benefit of his improvements? There were a great many cases in which no human mind could ever consider a landlord wanting it for his own purposes of occupation; and it was a reasonable thing that a landlord, having given a lease of his land many years ago, should have the power of resuming it at the termination of the lease if he wanted it for personal occupation. , he (Mr. T. P. OConnor) would ask, desirable that every landlord should have that power to use it at his will?'],
