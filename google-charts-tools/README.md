# About Google Charts

[Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart) is a suite of tools for visualizing data in a web framework. Google's version uses JavaScript, but various wrappers exist in other languages.

To make a wordtree: 
- (original) [Google Wordtree Chart](https://react-google-charts.com/wordtree-chart)
- (R wrapper) [gvisWordTree](https://rdrr.io/github/mages/googleVis/man/gvisWordTree.html)
    - Note: the R wrapper is missing some functionality, like a suffix tree.
