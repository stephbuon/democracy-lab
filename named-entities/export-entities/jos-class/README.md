Code I used to identify named entities for Jo's class. 


export_named_entities.py : import a data frame. Export .pickles that make up the same data frame, but with an additional column for named entities.

util/pyfunctions/jar_pickles_2 : concat .pickles into data frame.

I've already created this data frame. It can be found on Google Drive at data/projects/digital-history-class/us_congress_w_named_entities.tar.xz

subset_by_NE_category : subset by NE category (per Jo's organizational requeset) where each NE has its own data frame.
