# Democracy Lab

The purpose of this repository is to provide code and data to Democracy Lab's research assistants. Most code is designed to run "out-of-the-box" and calls directories specific to this repository's file system. To ensure consistent coding and organization practices, we ask RAs to refer to the [Democracy Lab Wiki](https://github.com/stephbuon/democracy-lab/wiki) before starting work.
